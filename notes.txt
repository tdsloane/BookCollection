# TO DO:
    - BUG ALERT: Despite my best efforts a bug where querying the database from read, unread, and all, results in all subsequent queries being printed unintentially in the result. I have tried deleting the query string and the selection dataframe after use but the problem persists. 
    - Research connecting to db from another computer (it's just local for now but we could look up how much it may cost to have a server hosted.)
    - Make executable.
    - Rest
